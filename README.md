# LongRangeScanners

**Programming Fundamentals Assessment Preparation**

A comprehensive collection of exercises and examples to help beginner Java and Python programmers prepare for programming fundamentals exams. 
This repository covers essential programming concepts with practical exercises in both languages (Java and Python).

This is where you, as a programmer, are going.
You're not expected to implement each of these exercises on the first try.
But over the course, you should get to a point where all of these are not that challenging.
Professionals will expect you to be able to solve problems like this standing at a whiteboard, in an interview, under pressure.

There are two tracks in here, one for Java programmers and one for Python programmers.
You know who you are. 

What's with the name? Well, As you know, every starship has long range scanners to show what's close and not so close. So it's a metaphorical nod to eventual knowledge.

## üìö Topics Covered

### Core Programming Concepts
- Variable declaration and initialization
- Control structures (if/else, switch/case)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Data structures (lists, maps/dictionaries)
- Exception handling
- Regular expressions

### String Manipulation
- Basic string operations
- String padding and trimming
- String formatting (left/right alignment)
- Number formatting in strings

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Fork and Clone this repository
   ```bash
   git clone ... (c'mon paste in the URL of Your forked copy of the Assigned REPO)
   cd LongRangeScanners
   ```

2. Choose your language directory:
   - For Java exercises: `cd java`
   - For Python exercises: `cd python`

3. Follow the numbered task directories in order
4. Read the README in each task directory for specific instructions
5. Complete the exercises and check your solutions

## üí° Study Tips

- If you use an AI, only ask it to explain the concepts, not solve the exercise
- Work through exercises in your primary language first
- Practice writing code by hand for exam preparation with no AI assist
- Focus on understanding concepts, not just memorizing syntax
- Test your code thoroughly with different inputs
- Read the tests that are there, they can help a lot
- Review error messages and learn from debugging
- You can work through both languages to understand similarities and differences
